This project was one of the more difficult ones because I had to learn a lot of new syntax. I was unfamiliar with classes, so I had to learn what a class was, how to define it, and how to define the functions within it. I also had to learn the difference between .h files and .cpp files. For example, my code would not compile even though there was no error line within my code. Eventually, I realized it was due to #include “Date.cpp” and #include “ZodiacReader.cpp”. This defined the classes and functions multiples times. To fix this, I included the header files instead. Overall, the most notable obstacles dealt with syntax.

Test cases:

getMonth()
	(6,17) - test for correctness
	(0,17) - when month is outside range of 1 to 12

getDay()
	(6,17) - test for correctness
	(6,35) - when day is outside range of 1 to 31

checkSign()
	(6,17) - test for correctness
	(6,20) - when day is on the deadline of a sign
	(6,21) - when day is on the start of a sign

onCusp()
	(6,17) - when day is not on cusp
	(6,19) - when day is a day before the deadline of a sign
	(6,20) - when day is on the deadline of a sign
	(6,21) - when day is on the start of a sign
	(6,22) - when day is a day after the start of a sign

cuspSign()
	(6,17) - when day is not on cusp
	(6,19) - when day is a day before the deadline of a sign
	(6,20) - when day is on the deadline of a sign
	(6,21) - when day is on the start of a sign
	(6,22) - when day is a day after the start of a sign
	(3,21) - when cusp sign jumps back to the last one
	(3,20) - when cusp sign jumps forward to the first one

stringifySign()
	(6,17) - test for correctness
